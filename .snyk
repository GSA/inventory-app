  SNYK-PYTHON-PYYAML-590151:
    - '*':
      reason: >-

  SNYK-PYTHON-M2CRYPTO-1040426:
    - '*':
        reason: >-
          Vulnerable code functions are not utilized in CKAN code base (RSA decrypt functionality).
          No fix for M2Crypto (RSA module) at this time.
          Community believes this to be a medium severity vulnerability.

  SNYK-PYTHON-IPADDRESS-1041793:
    - '*':
        reason: >-
          Fix not available. No known usage of this library inside the CKAN app or it's extensions.

  SNYK-PYTHON-IPADDRESS-590065:
    - '*':
        reason: >-
          No remediation available yet.  After inspecting the
          Python cryptography package, there is no use of the vulnerable
          method hash() on the classes IPv4Interface and IPv6Interface, 
          so the risk here is very minimal.

  SNYK-PYTHON-CRYPTOGRAPHY-1022152:
    - '*':
        reason: >-
          Patched to version 3.2; long term fix expected later.
          Version 3.2 of this package contains an incomplete fix,
          which might help reduce the chances of this vulnerability 
          being exploited.
