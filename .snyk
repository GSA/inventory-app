          After inspecting the Python cryptography package, I see no use of the
          vulnerable method hash() on the classes IPv4Interface and
          IPv6Interface, so the risk here is very minimal. We expect a fix to be
          made available before our 90 day SLA for this moderate severity issue.

          Version 3.2 of this package contains an incomplete fix,
          which might help reduce the chances of this vulnerability 
          being exploited.
