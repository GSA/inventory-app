          After inspecting the Python cryptography package, I see no use of the
          vulnerable method hash() on the classes IPv4Interface and
          IPv6Interface, so the risk here is very minimal. We expect a fix to be
          made available before our 90 day SLA for this moderate severity issue.

          Version 3.2 of this package contains an incomplete fix,
