  SNYK-PYTHON-M2CRYPTO-1040426:
    - '*':
        reason: >-
          Vulnerable code functions are not utilized in CKAN code base (RSA decrypt functionality).
          No fix for M2Crypto (RSA module) at this time.
          Community believes this to be a medium severity vulnerability.

  SNYK-PYTHON-IPADDRESS-590065:
    - '*':
        reason: >-
          No remediation available yet.  After inspecting the
          Python cryptography package, there is no use of the vulnerable
          method hash() on the classes IPv4Interface and IPv6Interface, 
          so the risk here is very minimal.
