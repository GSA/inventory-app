An attacker can execute arbitrary code, corrupt valid data or cause a crash by exploiting the freed memory area.\r\n\r\nThe `SSL_free_buffers` function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used when processing an incoming record from the network. The call is only expected to succeed if the buffer is not currently in use. However, two scenarios have been identified where the buffer is freed even when still in use.\r\n\r\n1) The first scenario occurs where a record header has been received from the network and processed by OpenSSL, but the full record body has not yet arrived. In this case calling `SSL_free_buffers` will succeed even though a record has only been partially processed and the buffer is still in use.\r\n\r\n2) The second scenario occurs where a full record containing application data has been received and processed by OpenSSL but the application has only read part of this data. Again a call to `SSL_free_buffers` will succeed even though the buffer is still in use.\r\n\r\nWhile these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a malicious attacker could attempt to engineer a situation where this occurs.\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\n\r\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `pyOpenSSL`.\n\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/704f725b96aa373ee45ecfb23f6abfe8be8d9177)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/b3f0eb0a295f58f16ba43ba99dad70d4ee5c437d)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/c88c3de51020c37e8706bf7a682a162593053aac)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/e5093133c35ca82874ad83697af76f4b0f7e3bd8)\n- [OpenSSL Advisory](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240528.txt)\n- [RedHat Bugzilla Bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2283757)\n",

An attacker can execute arbitrary code, corrupt valid data or cause a crash by exploiting the freed memory area.\r\n\r\nThe `SSL_free_buffers` function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used when processing an incoming record from the network. The call is only expected to succeed if the buffer is not currently in use. However, two scenarios have been identified where the buffer is freed even when still in use.\r\n\r\n1) The first scenario occurs where a record header has been received from the network and processed by OpenSSL, but the full record body has not yet arrived. In this case calling `SSL_free_buffers` will succeed even though a record has only been partially processed and the buffer is still in use.\r\n\r\n2) The second scenario occurs where a full record containing application data has been received and processed by OpenSSL but the application has only read part of this data. Again a call to `SSL_free_buffers` will succeed even though the buffer is still in use.\r\n\r\nWhile these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a malicious attacker could attempt to engineer a situation where this occurs.\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\n\r\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `pyOpenSSL`.\n\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/704f725b96aa373ee45ecfb23f6abfe8be8d9177)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/b3f0eb0a295f58f16ba43ba99dad70d4ee5c437d)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/c88c3de51020c37e8706bf7a682a162593053aac)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/e5093133c35ca82874ad83697af76f4b0f7e3bd8)\n- [OpenSSL Advisory](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240528.txt)\n- [RedHat Bugzilla Bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2283757)\n",

      "description": "## Overview\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) when parsing multipart form data. An attacker can trigger the opening of multipart files containing a large number of file parts, which are processed using `request.data`, `request.form`, `request.files`, or `request.get_data(parse_form_data=False)`, consuming CPU, memory, or file handles resources. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling other requests. The amount of RAM required can trigger an out-of-memory and crash the process.\n\n## Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\n\nUnlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `werkzeug` to version 2.2.3 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/517cac5a804e8c4dc4ed038bb20dacd038e7a9f1)\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/releases/tag/2.2.3)\n",

      "description": "## Overview\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) when parsing multipart form data. An attacker can trigger the opening of multipart files containing a large number of file parts, which are processed using `request.data`, `request.form`, `request.files`, or `request.get_data(parse_form_data=False)`, consuming CPU, memory, or file handles resources. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling other requests. The amount of RAM required can trigger an out-of-memory and crash the process.\n\n## Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\n\nUnlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `werkzeug` to version 2.2.3 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/517cac5a804e8c4dc4ed038bb20dacd038e7a9f1)\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/releases/tag/2.2.3)\n",

      "description": "## Overview\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) when parsing multipart form data. An attacker can trigger the opening of multipart files containing a large number of file parts, which are processed using `request.data`, `request.form`, `request.files`, or `request.get_data(parse_form_data=False)`, consuming CPU, memory, or file handles resources. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling other requests. The amount of RAM required can trigger an out-of-memory and crash the process.\n\n## Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\n\nUnlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `werkzeug` to version 2.2.3 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/517cac5a804e8c4dc4ed038bb20dacd038e7a9f1)\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/releases/tag/2.2.3)\n",

      "description": "## Overview\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) when parsing multipart form data. An attacker can trigger the opening of multipart files containing a large number of file parts, which are processed using `request.data`, `request.form`, `request.files`, or `request.get_data(parse_form_data=False)`, consuming CPU, memory, or file handles resources. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling other requests. The amount of RAM required can trigger an out-of-memory and crash the process.\n\n## Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\n\nUnlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `werkzeug` to version 2.2.3 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/517cac5a804e8c4dc4ed038bb20dacd038e7a9f1)\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/releases/tag/2.2.3)\n",

An attacker can cause a denial of service and block worker processes from handling legitimate requests by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it, eventually exhausting or killing all available workers. \r\n\r\nExploiting this vulnerability is possible if the uploaded file starts with `CR` or `LF` and is followed by megabytes of data without these characters.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `werkzeug` to version 2.3.8, 3.0.1 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/f2300208d5e2a5076cbbb4c2aad71096fd040ef9)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/f3c803b3ade485a45f12b6d6617595350c0f03e2)\n",

        "description": "## Overview\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Use After Free via the `SSL_free_buffers` function. An attacker can execute arbitrary code, corrupt valid data or cause a crash by exploiting the freed memory area.\r\n\r\nThe `SSL_free_buffers` function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used when processing an incoming record from the network. The call is only expected to succeed if the buffer is not currently in use. However, two scenarios have been identified where the buffer is freed even when still in use.\r\n\r\n1) The first scenario occurs where a record header has been received from the network and processed by OpenSSL, but the full record body has not yet arrived. In this case calling `SSL_free_buffers` will succeed even though a record has only been partially processed and the buffer is still in use.\r\n\r\n2) The second scenario occurs where a full record containing application data has been received and processed by OpenSSL but the application has only read part of this data. Again a call to `SSL_free_buffers` will succeed even though the buffer is still in use.\r\n\r\nWhile these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a malicious attacker could attempt to engineer a situation where this occurs.\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\n\r\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `cryptography`.\n\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/704f725b96aa373ee45ecfb23f6abfe8be8d9177)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/b3f0eb0a295f58f16ba43ba99dad70d4ee5c437d)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/c88c3de51020c37e8706bf7a682a162593053aac)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/e5093133c35ca82874ad83697af76f4b0f7e3bd8)\n- [OpenSSL Advisory](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240528.txt)\n- [RedHat Bugzilla Bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2283757)\n",

        "description": "## Overview\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Use After Free via the `SSL_free_buffers` function. An attacker can execute arbitrary code, corrupt valid data or cause a crash by exploiting the freed memory area.\r\n\r\nThe `SSL_free_buffers` function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used when processing an incoming record from the network. The call is only expected to succeed if the buffer is not currently in use. However, two scenarios have been identified where the buffer is freed even when still in use.\r\n\r\n1) The first scenario occurs where a record header has been received from the network and processed by OpenSSL, but the full record body has not yet arrived. In this case calling `SSL_free_buffers` will succeed even though a record has only been partially processed and the buffer is still in use.\r\n\r\n2) The second scenario occurs where a full record containing application data has been received and processed by OpenSSL but the application has only read part of this data. Again a call to `SSL_free_buffers` will succeed even though the buffer is still in use.\r\n\r\nWhile these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a malicious attacker could attempt to engineer a situation where this occurs.\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\n\r\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `pyOpenSSL`.\n\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/704f725b96aa373ee45ecfb23f6abfe8be8d9177)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/b3f0eb0a295f58f16ba43ba99dad70d4ee5c437d)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/c88c3de51020c37e8706bf7a682a162593053aac)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/e5093133c35ca82874ad83697af76f4b0f7e3bd8)\n- [OpenSSL Advisory](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240528.txt)\n- [RedHat Bugzilla Bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2283757)\n",

        "description": "## Overview\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) when parsing multipart form data. An attacker can trigger the opening of multipart files containing a large number of file parts, which are processed using `request.data`, `request.form`, `request.files`, or `request.get_data(parse_form_data=False)`, consuming CPU, memory, or file handles resources. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling other requests. The amount of RAM required can trigger an out-of-memory and crash the process.\n\n## Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\n\nUnlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `werkzeug` to version 2.2.3 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/517cac5a804e8c4dc4ed038bb20dacd038e7a9f1)\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/releases/tag/2.2.3)\n",
