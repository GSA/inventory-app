# inventory-app

Is a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)-based [CKAN](http://ckan.org) development environment for [inventory.data.gov](https://inventory.data.gov).

_Note: this is currently a work in progress. We're mainly using this to manage
the `requirements-freeze.txt` for production dependencies. Very little works beyond that._


## Development


### Prerequisites

- [Docker and Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)


### Getting started

Build and bring up the containers.

    $ make up
    $ make up-with-data [_Gives development environment basic user, organization, and dataset_]

You may optionally seed the inventory with a default user, organization, and dataset by running the following command in the folder while the docker-compose is still up and has finished running:

    $ docker-compose exec app /opt/inventory-app/seed.sh

_If the user is already created and you would like to rebuild the organization and dataset, you can specify the API key as a second argument to the execution: `docker-compose exec app /opt/inventory-app/seed.sh long-api-key`_

Open CKAN to verify it's working

    $ open http://localhost:5000

### Docker-compose commands

To enter into the app container in interactive mode as root, you will need to run the following:

    $ docker-compose exec app /bin/bash

To run a one off command inside the container:

    $ docker-compose exec app {command}

Update dependencies.

    $ make update-dependencies

Update lock file for dependencies. **Because of a version conflict for
repoze.who, special care should be taken to make sure that repoze.who==1.0.18 is
shipped to production in order to be compatible with ckanext-saml2. After
generating the requirements-freeze.txt, manually review the file to make sure
the versions are correct. See https://github.com/GSA/catalog-app/issues/78 for
more details.**

    $ make requirements


### Live Editing

To edit CKAN or extension code live, the attached volume needs to be found and used.

You can find the volume by running `docker volume ls`, but the default is `inventoryapp_ckan`. You can then run `docker volume inspect inventoryapp_ckan` to get the location details on your local machine. You may need to edit permissions to this folder to edit under your current user. Once this is complete, use your preferred editor to manage the code as needed.

If you restart the service, the volume stays live. It must be removed manually. If you make edits and want to revert, you can run `docker volume rm -f inventoryapp_ckan`. The docker containers need to be stopped and removed before you can run this command.

### Tests

    $ make test
