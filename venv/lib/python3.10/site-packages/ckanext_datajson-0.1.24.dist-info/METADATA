# ckanext-datajson

[![Github Actions](https://github.com/GSA/ckanext-datajson/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/GSA/ckanext-datajson/actions)
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/ckanext-datajson.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/ckanext-datajson)

A CKAN extension containing plugins `datajson`.
First is used by http://catalog.data.gov/ to harvest data sources
from a remote /data.json file according to the U.S. Project
Open Data metadata specification (https://resources.data.gov/schemas/dcat-us/v1.1/).

Plugin `datajson` provides a harvester to import datasets from other
remote /data.json files. See below for setup instructions.

And the plugin also provides a new view to validate /data.json files
at http://ckanhostname/dcat-us/validator.


## Features

- [:heavy_check_mark:] **datajson** provides data.json export and DCAT-US metadata UI integration
  - Read more about [`datajson`](docs/datajson.md)
- [:heavy_check_mark:] **datajson_harvest** extends [ckanext-harvest](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-harvest/)
to collect metadata fromremote data.json sources
  - Read more about [`datajson_harvest`](docs/datajson_harvest.md)
- [:warning:] **cmsdatanav_harvest** extends [ckanext-harvest](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-harvest/)
to collect metadata from for the CMS Data Navigator catalog
- [:heavy_check_mark:] **datajson_validator** provides a web form to validate dcat-us metadata data.json compliance.
  - Read more about [`datajson_validator`](docs/datajson_validator.md)


## Usage

### Requirements

All requirements are tracked `setup.py` when possible.  Some CKAN extensions are not on PyPI, so they 
(and their dependencies) must be tracked in `requirements.txt`.
- [ckanext-harvest](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-harvest/)

CKAN version   | Compatibility
-------------- | -------------
<=2.7          | :x:
2.8            | :warning:
2.9.5          | :heavy_check_mark:
2.9.6          | :heavy_check_mark:

### Installation

To install, activate your CKAN virtualenv, install dependencies, and
install the module in develop mode, which just puts the directory in your
Python path.

	. path/to/pyenv/bin/activate
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	python setup.py develop

Then in your CKAN .ini file, add `datajson`
to your ckan.plugins line:

	ckan.plugins = (other plugins here...) datajson

That's the plugin for /data.json output. To make the harvester available,
also add:

	ckan.plugins = (other plugins here...) harvest datajson_harvest
	
To make the datajson validator route and web form available, also add:

	ckan.plugins = (other plugins here...) datajson_validator


## Development

### Setup

Build the docker containers.

    $ make build

Start the docker containers.

    $ make up

CKAN will start at [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).

Clean up any containers and volumes.

    $ make clean

Open a shell to run commands in the container.

    $ docker-compose exec app /bin/bash

If you're unfamiliar with docker-compose, see our
[cheatsheet](https://github.com/GSA/datagov-deploy/wiki/Docker-Best-Practices#cheatsheet)
and the [official docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/).

For additional make targets, see the help.

    $ make help


### Testing

They follow the guidelines for [testing CKAN
extensions](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.9/extensions/testing-extensions.html#testing-extensions).

To run the extension tests, start the containers with `make up`, then:

    $ make test

Lint the code.

    $ make lint


### Matrix builds

The test development environment drops as many dependencies as possible. It is
not meant to have feature parity with
[GSA/catalog.data.gov](https://github.com/GSA/catalog.data.gov/). Tests should
mock external dependencies where possible.

In order to support multiple versions of CKAN, or even upgrade to new versions
of CKAN, we support development and testing through the `CKAN_VERSION`
environment variable.

    $ make CKAN_VERSION=2.9.5 test
    $ make CKAN_VERSION=2.9 test
    
Note: When testing patch versions of CKAN, the services may not have patch releases.
So, take note of the `SERVICES_VERSION` variable which tracks the minor release to 
pull for the `db` and `solr` images.
